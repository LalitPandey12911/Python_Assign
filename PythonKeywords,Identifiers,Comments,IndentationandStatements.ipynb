    "SIGNIFICANCE:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Python keywords are reserved words that have predefined meanings and cannot be used for any other purpose within the Python language. They play a crucial role in defining the syntax and structure of Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLE:-\n",
    "\n",
    "A) if:\n",
    "     The if keyword is used to create conditional statements in Python. It allows the execution of certain code blocks based on whether a specified condition evaluates to True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) for:\n",
    "      The for keyword is used to iterate over a sequence (such as lists, tuples, strings, etc.) or other iterable objects. It helps in performing repetitive tasks efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) def:\n",
    "      The def keyword is used to define functions in Python. Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code and promoting reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "D) return: \n",
    "          The return keyword is used to exit a function and return a value to the caller. It specifies the result of a function and can pass data back to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "E) in:\n",
    "      The in keyword is used to check if a value exists within a sequence (such as lists, tuples, strings, etc.). It's also used in for loops for iteration.\n"

    "QUE-2. Describe the rules for defining identifiers in Python and provide an example\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Allowed Characters:\n",
    "  Identifiers can consist of alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and the underscore character (_). However, they cannot start with a digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 Case Sensitivity:\n",
    "  Python identifiers are case-sensitive, meaning uppercase and lowercase letters are distinct. For example, `MyVar`, `myvar`, and `MYVAR` are considere     different identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 Reserved Keywords:\n",
    "  Identifiers cannot be the same as Python keywords (such as `if`, `for`, `def`, etc.), as they are reserved for specific purposes within the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 Length:\n",
    "  There is no limit on the length of identifiers, but it's good practice to keep them reasonably short and descriptive for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "5 Cannot Contain Spaces or Special Characters:\n",
    "  Identifiers cannot contain spaces or special characters such as !, @, #, $, %, etc. The only exception is the underscore (_) character.\n",
    "\n",
    "6 Cannot Start with a Digit:\n",
    "  Identifiers cannot start with a digit. They must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLE:-\n",

    "myVar = \"Hello\"\n",
    "my_function = lambda x: x * 2\n",

    "# Invalid identifiers\n",
    "3var = 10  # Cannot start with a digit\n",
    "my-variable = \"Invalid\"  # Cannot contain special characters\n",

    "QUE-6 .Differentiate Between expression and statement in Python with examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Expression:\n",
    "   - An expression is any valid piece of code that evaluates to a value.\n",
    "   - It can be a combination of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that result in a single value.\n",
    "   - Expressions can be used within larger expressions, assignments, or function calls.\n",
    "   - They can be part of statements.\n",
    "   - Examples of expressions:\n",
    "     - Arithmetic expressions: `2 + 3`, `x * y`\n",
    "     - Boolean expressions: `x > 5`, `y == z`\n",
    "     - Function calls: `len(\"hello\")`, `math.sqrt(25)`\n",
    "     - List comprehensions: `[x**2 for x in range(5)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Statement**:\n",
    "   - A statement is a complete instruction that performs an action or controls the flow of execution.\n",
    "   - It may consist of expressions, but it doesn't necessarily evaluate to a value.\n",
    "   - Statements often include keywords like `if`, `while`, `for`, `def`, `class`, etc.\n",
    "   - They can span multiple lines and may contain expressions as part of their structure.\n",
    "   - Examples of statements:\n",
    "     - Assignment statement: `x = 5`, `y = x + 3`\n",
    "     - Conditional statement: `if x > 0:`\n",
    "     - Looping statement: `for i in range(5):`\n",
    "     - Function definition: `def my_function(x):`\n",
    "     - Class definition: `class MyClass:`\n",
